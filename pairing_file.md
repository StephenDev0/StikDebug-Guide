## Pairing Guide

idevice_pair allows us to create a pairing file for programs like StikDebug to talk to your device remotely. This pairing file is device-specific, time-specific and required to use StikDebug, otherwise StikDebug will not function correctly. Caution: this pairing file can and will expire randomly, requiring you to recreate it. This is due to Apple's systems and there is nothing we can do about it.

### Prerequisites
First, set a passcode on your device, sideload an app with the `get-task-allow` entitlement (this can be done with the in-app signer \[coming soon, in the meantime use Feather] and a development certificate, or for free utilizing a PC and [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/)), and enable Developer Mode on your iOS/iPadOS device (found at the bottom of Settings â†’ Privacy & Security). Then, follow the instructions below to create and import your pairing file.
